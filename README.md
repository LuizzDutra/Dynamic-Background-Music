"# Dynamic-Background-Music" 

Did You always want to have the OperaGX dynamic background music in your Windows Desktop?
Do You enjoy the music changing when you start to type?

Worry no more, with this script you can have just that on your desktop.

Windows ONLY.(unless you change the way the script gets the keystrokes yourself to be compatible with your system).
